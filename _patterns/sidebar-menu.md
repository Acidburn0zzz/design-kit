description: Example copy action lists render a list of actions or selectable options. This component is usually placed inside a popover container to create a dropdown menu or to let merchants select from a list of options.
problem: Example copy there are lots of different paths a merchant can take. Listing them all out in the interface would make the experience feel overwhelming and cluttered.
solution: Example copy action lists in popovers let merchants expose additional information and actions when theyâ€™re ready to explore them.
